Homer

(line 128)

"If indeed as one of the immortals you had come down from the skies, I would not for my part do battle with the heavenly gods; no, not even the son of Dryas, strong Lycurgus, who was long-lived, who it seems quarrelled with the heavenly gods. Once he started to drive away the attendants of raving Bacchus from most divine Mt. Nysa; all at the same time they shed their sacred tools on the ground, slain as they were with an ox-goad by man-killing Lycurgus. Dionysus, fearing, entered into the waves of the ocean, and Thetis drew him to her bosom, shrinking from Lycurgus, as a strong quaking held him because of the man's threat. (line 138)

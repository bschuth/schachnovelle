# Odyssey A

Homer

That man, speak to me of him, Muses, the much-traveled-and-talented, who was turned back so many times, after he laid waste to the holy city of Troy. There were many men whose cities he saw, and he knew their minds, many also indeed the pains he suffered in his hear over the ocean as he strived to save his life and the homecoming of his comrades. But no, he was did not thus save them despite his effort.

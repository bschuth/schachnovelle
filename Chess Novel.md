# Chess Novel

Stefan Zweig

On the large passenger ship that was to departe at midnight from Buenos Aires to New York, the usual bustle and commotion of the last hour prevailed. Guests from land hurried here and there in confusion, giving escort to their friends, telegraph boys with crooked caps shouted names through the reception rooms, boxes and flowers were brought, children ran around inquisitively up and down stairs, while the orchestra unflappingly played the deck show. I stood in conversation with an acquaintance a little aside from this turmoil on the Promenade deck, when near us two or three flashbulbs went off sharply: apparently there was some prominent person rushing in right before the departure being interviewed by reporters and being photographed. My friend looked at them and laughed. "We have a rare bird on board, Czantovic." And since I evidently made a sufficiently uncomprehending face at this announcement, he went on, explaining: "Mirko Czentovic, the world champion chess master. He has beaten tournament players all cross America from east to west and he goes now to new triumphs in Argentina. "

And now I remembered this young world champion and even some details in connection with his stratospheric career. My friend, a more observant newspaper reader than I, was able to to provide a series of anecdotes. Czentovic had for about a year at one series played against the proven senior champtions of the art of chess, like Alechin, Capablanca, Tartakover, Lasker, Bogoljubov; not since the debut of the seven year old Wunderkind Rzewski at the 1922 New York chess tourney had there been an introduction of a complete unknown in the glorious guild in such a way universal a sensation stirred up.
